## Interface
An interface is like a set of rules for a class that the class must defline once implemented

## Examples
This project contains two interfaces: ICanFly & ILayEggs. The idea is that the animals that can do these things will have these interfaces implemented.
The bird class gets both of these interfaces, which means all birds (pretending all birds can fly) can fly and lay eggs.
Other animals, like bees also got the ICanFly interface, and animals like crustaceans for the ILayEggs interface.
